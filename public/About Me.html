<h3> To begin with,I must say that this is my very first portafolio in which I would like to show off my skills as Data Scientist mainly, besides some skills as Web Developer. I hah been involved 
    in the academic world as a teacher of physics and mathematics. However, I have been intrigued by the power of the data and the Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, I started to study through
    some bootcamps and selfstudy. Besides, I am working on several personal projects of machine learning from Kaggle primarily.
